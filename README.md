#  Real-time AI Context Updater

This project is a **real-time AI context updater and editor** built using **Next.js** and **WebSockets** to ensure smooth and live AI-driven content generation and draft editing.

## Live Demo

 [Check it out here](https://ai-chatfrontend-git-main-amans-projects-1073e066.vercel.app/)

To make the AI context reactive and update it in real-time, I integrated a **WebSocket server**. This was my first time working with WebSockets, but it allowed me to build a dynamic environment where the AI context updates live as users interact.

For content generation and draft editing, I used **Next.js server functions** to stream AI-generated content directly to the frontend.
